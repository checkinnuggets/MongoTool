# MongoTool
Very Simple Windows GUI Tool for Mongo DB

You know when you write pages of technical justification to demonstrate why MongoDB is the right choice, then you get to use it, but then you can't get a $99 MongoChef license.  That.

RoboMongo is great but doesn't seem to support WiredTiger.

I knocked this up in about an hour as a proof of concept to prove it is as easy as I thought it would be - at least to implement the very simple subset of features that I require.

- Connect to Server
- List Databases (+ Delete Database)
- List Collections in Database (+ Delete Colletion)
- List Documents in Collection
- View Document (+ Delete Document)

I don't have plans to write a fully featured MongoDB tool, but I'll add features as I need them.  At the minute it's just having a look at the odd record and deleting stuff.
